## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

The way it works is basically a single button which changes function depending on whether the game has started or not. 
The game gets a random number for a timer and after that amount of time it changes the colour of the section to red. The user then clicks as fast as possible to get the lowest reaction speed they can. 
The reaction speed is placed in a span for the user to see. If they try to click before the section changes to red it will give them a warning telling them they clicked too quickly. 


## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I'm not 100% sure how reliable the reaction speed result is, but I think it should be fairly close. The speed in which functions occur may cause a slight delay I imagine. It would be cool to add an average over 5 tries and let that be the result instead. Maybe I'll work on that in the future, it should be fairly straightforward to implement. 

## Lessons Learned:

Some interesting little oddities here and there with timers. Overall nothing was too difficult and it didn't take very long, but it was fun to implement it all together and figure out how to make it work with just a single button that controls everything.
